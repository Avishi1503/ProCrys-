THEN, ARC-780 WAS ADDED TO AN INITIAL CONCENTRATION OF 1 MM BY ADDING 1 MIKROLITER OF A 10 MM ARC-780 SOLUTION IN DMSO IN A 1:10 RATIO TO THE DROPLET. AFTER EXTENSIVE INTIAL SOAKING, THE SALT CONCENTRATION WAS SUCCESSIVELY LOWERED OVER A PERIOD OF 8 MONTHS WHILE IN PARALLEL THE CONCENTRATIONS OF DMSO AND PEG 6000 WERE INCREASED. THIS WAS DONE BY GRADUALLY REPLACING THE RESERVOIR AND THE DROPLET SOLUTION UNTIL ANY NACL WAS REMOVED, THE LICL CONCENTRATION WAS REDUCED TO 50 MM, THE PEG 6000 CONCENTRATION WAS INCREASED TO SATURATION AND A DMSO CONTENT OF 30% WAS REACHED.
